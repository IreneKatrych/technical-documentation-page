            <p>C# is a simple, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language developed by
                Microsoft within its .NET initiative led by Anders Hejlsberg. This tutorial will teach
                you basic C# programming and will also take you through various advanced concepts related to C#
                programming language.</p>
            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>This tutorial has been prepared for the beginners to help them understand basic C# programming.</p>
            <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
            <p>C# programming is very much based on C and C++ programming languages, so if you have a basic
                understanding of C or C++ programming, then it will be fun to learn C#.</p>

                <h2>Environment</h2>
            </header>
            <p>In this chapter, we will discuss the tools required for creating C# programming. We have already
                mentioned that C# is part of .Net framework and is used for writing .Net applications. Therefore, before
                discussing the available tools for running a C# program, let us understand how C# relates to the .Net
                framework.</p>
            <h3>The .Net Framework</h3>
            <p>The .Net framework is a revolutionary platform that helps you to write the following types of
                applications −</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Windows applications</li>
                <li>Web applications</li>
                <li>Web services</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The .Net framework applications are multi-platform applications. The framework has been designed in such
                a way that it can be used from any of the following languages: C#, C++, Visual Basic, Jscript, COBOL,
                etc. All these languages can access the framework as well as communicate with each other.</p>
            <p>The .Net framework consists of an enormous library of codes used by the client languages such as C#.
                Following are some of the components of the .Net framework −</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Common Language Runtime (CLR)</li>
                <li>The .Net Framework Class Library</li>
                <li>Common Language Specification</li>
                <li>Common Type System</li>
                <li>Metadata and Assemblies</li>
                <li>Windows Forms</li>
                <li>ASP.Net and ASP.Net AJAX</li>
                <li>ADO.Net</li>
                <li>Windows Workflow Foundation (WF)</li>
                <li>Windows Presentation Foundation</li>
                <li>Windows Presentation Foundation</li>
                <li>LINQ</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For the jobs each of these components perform, please see <a
                    href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/asp.net/asp.net_introduction.htm">ASP.Net - Introduction</a>,
                and for details of each component, please consult Microsoft's documentation.</p>
            <h3>Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for C#</h3>
            <p>Microsoft provides the following development tools for C# programming −</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Visual Studio 2010 (VS)</li>
                <li>Visual C# 2010 Express (VCE)</li>
                <li>Visual Web Developer</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The last two are freely available from Microsoft official website. Using these tools, you can write all
                kinds of C# programs from simple command-line applications to more complex applications. You can also
                write C# source code files using a basic text editor, like Notepad, and compile the code into assemblies
                using the command-line compiler, which is again a part of the .NET Framework.</p>
            <p>Visual C# Express and Visual Web Developer Express edition are trimmed down versions of Visual Studio and
                has the same appearance. They retain most features of Visual Studio. In this tutorial, we have used
                Visual C# 2010 Express.</p>
            <p>You can download it from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads">Microsoft Visual
                    Studio</a>. It gets installed automatically on your machine.</p>
            <p>Note: You need an active internet connection for installing the express edition.</p>
            <h3>Writing C# Programs on Linux or Mac OS</h3>
            <p>Although the.NET Framework runs on the Windows operating system, there are some alternative versions that
                work on other operating systems. Mono is an open-source version of the .NET Framework which includes a
                C# compiler
                and runs on several operating systems, including various flavors of Linux and Mac OS. Kindly check <a
                    href="http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html">Go Mono</a>.</p>

                <h2>Program Structure</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Before we study basic building blocks of the C# programming language, let us look at a bare minimum C#
                program structure so that we can take it as a reference in upcoming chapters.</p>
            <h3>Creating Hello World Program</h3>
            <p>A C# program consists of the following parts −</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Namespace declaration</li>
                <li>A class</li>
                <li>Class methods</li>
                <li>Class attributes</li>
                <li>A Main method</li>
                <li>Statements and Expressions</li>
                <li>Comments</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Let us look at a simple code that prints the words "Hello World" −</p>
            <div class="codes">
                <code>
                            using System;<br>
                            namespace HelloWorldApplication {<br>
                               class HelloWorld {<br>
                                  static void Main(string[] args) {<br>
                                     /* my first program in C# */<br>
                                     Console.WriteLine("Hello World");<br>
                                     Console.ReadKey();<br>
                                  }<br>
                               }<br>
                            }
                    </code>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>When this code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result −</p>
            <div class="codes"> <code>Hello World</code></div>
            <p>Let us look at the various parts of the given program −</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The first line of the program <strong>using System</strong>; - the <strong>using</strong> keyword is used to include the
                    <strong>System</strong> namespace in the program. A program generally has multiple <strong>using</strong> statements.
                </li>
                <li>The next line has the <strong>namespace</strong> declaration. A <strong>namespace</strong> is a collection of classes.
                    The <em>HelloWorldApplication</em> namespace contains the class <em>HelloWorld</em>.</li>
                <li>The next line has a <strong>class</strong> declaration, the class <em>HelloWorld</em> contains the data and
                    method definitions that your program uses. Classes generally contain multiple methods. Methods
                    define the behavior of the class. However, the <em>HelloWorld</em> class has only one method
                    <strong>Main</strong>.</li>
                <li>The next line defines the <strong>Main</strong> method, which is the <strong>entry point</strong> for all C# programs.
                    The <strong>Main</strong> method states what the class does when executed.</li>
                <li>The next line /*...*/ is ignored by the compiler and it is put to add <strong>comments</strong> in the
                    program.</li>
                <li>
                    <p>The Main method specifies its behavior with the statement <strong>Console.WriteLine("Hello
                            World");</strong></p>
                    <p><em>WriteLine</em> is a method of the <em>Console</em> class defined in the <em>System</em> namespace.
                        This statement causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.</p>
                </li>
                <li>The last line <strong>Console.ReadKey();</strong> is for the VS.NET Users. This makes the program wait for a
                    key press and it prevents the screen from running and closing quickly when the program is launched
                    from Visual Studio .NET.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is worth to note the following points −</p>
            <ul>
                <li>C# is case sensitive.</li>
                <li>All statements and expression must end with a semicolon (;).</li>
                <li>The program execution starts at the Main method.</li>
                <li>Unlike Java, program file name could be different from the class name.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Compiling and Executing the Program</h3>
            <p>If you are using Visual Studio.Net for compiling and executing C# programs, take the following steps −
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Start Visual Studio.</li>
                <li>On the menu bar, choose File -> New -> Project.</li>
                <li>Choose Visual C# from templates, and then choose Windows.</li>
                <li>Choose Console Application.</li>
                <li>Specify a name for your project and click OK button.</li>
                <li>This creates a new project in Solution Explorer.</li>
                <li>Write code in the Code Editor.</li>
                <li>Click the Run button or press F5 key to execute the project. A Command Prompt window appears that
                    contains the line Hello World.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can compile a C# program by using the command-line instead of the Visual Studio IDE −</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.</li>
                <li>Save the file as <strong>helloworld.cs</strong></li>
                <li>Open the command prompt tool and go to the directory where you saved the file.</li>
                <li>Type <strong>csc helloworld.cs</strong> and press enter to compile your code.</li>
                <li>If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt takes you to the next line and generates
                    <strong>helloworld.exe</strong> executable file.</li>
                <li>Type <strong>helloworld</strong> to execute your program.</li>
                <li>You can see the output Hello World printed on the screen.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="Basic_Syntax">
            <header>
                <h2>Basic Syntax</h2>
            </header>
            <p> C# is an object-oriented programming language. In Object-Oriented Programming methodology, a program
                consists of various objects that interact with each other by means of actions. The actions that an
                object may take are called methods. Objects of the same kind are said to have the same type or, are said
                to be in the same class.</p>
            <p>For example, let us consider a Rectangle object. It has attributes such as length and width. Depending
                upon the design, it may need ways for accepting the values of these attributes, calculating the area,
                and displaying details.</p>
            <p>Let us look at implementation of a Rectangle class and discuss C# basic syntax −</p>
            <div class="codes">
                <code>
                    using System;<br>
                    namespace RectangleApplication {<br>
                    class Rectangle {<br>
                    // member variables<br>
                    double length;<br>
                    double width;<br>
                    public void Acceptdetails() {<br>
                    length = 4.5;    <br>
                    width = 3.5;<br>
                    }<br>
                    public double GetArea() {<br>
                    return length * width; <br>
                    }<br>
                    public void Display() {<br>
                    Console.WriteLine("Length: {0}", length);<br>
                    Console.WriteLine("Width: {0}", width);<br>
                    Console.WriteLine("Area: {0}", GetArea());<br>
                    }<br>
                    }<br>
                    class ExecuteRectangle {<br>
                    static void Main(string[] args) {<br>
                    Rectangle r = new Rectangle();<br>
                    r.Acceptdetails();<br>
                    r.Display();<br>
                    Console.ReadLine();<br> 
                    }<br>
                    }<br>
                    }
                   </code>
            </div><br>
            <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result −</p>
            <div class="codes">
                <code>Length: 4.5<br>
                    Width: 3.5<br>
                    Area: 15.75
                    </code>
            </div><br>
            <h3>The <em>using</em> Keyword</h3>
            <p>The first statement in any C# program is</p>
            <div class="codes"> <code>using System;</code></div><br>
            <p>The <strong>using</strong> keyword is used for including the namespaces in the program. A program can include
                multiple using statements.</p>
            <h3>The <em>class</em> Keyword</h3>
            <p>The <strong>class</strong> keyword is used for declaring a class.</p>
            <h3>Comments in C#</h3>
            <p>Comments are used for explaining code. Compilers ignore the comment entries. The multiline comments in C#
                programs start with /* and terminates with the characters */ as shown below −</p>
            <div class="codes">
                <code>
                    /* This program demonstrates<br>
                    The basic syntax of C# programming <br>
                    Language */
                    </code>
            </div><br>
            <p>Single-line comments are indicated by the '//' symbol. For example,</p>
            <div class="codes"><code>}//end class Rectangle</code></div><br>
            <h3>Member Variables</h3>
            <p>Variables are attributes or data members of a class, used for storing data. In the preceding program, the
                <em>Rectangle</em> class has two member variables named <em>length</em> and <em>width</em>.</p>
            <h3>Member Functions</h3>
            <p>Functions are set of statements that perform a specific task. The member functions of a class are
                declared within the class. Our sample class Rectangle contains three member functions:
                <em>AcceptDetails</em>, <em>GetArea</em> and <em>Display</em>.</p>
            <h3>Instantiating a Class</h3>
            <p>In the preceding program, the class <em>ExecuteRectangle</em> contains the <em>Main()</em> method and
                instantiates the <em>Rectangle</em> class.</p>
            <h3>Identifiers</h3>
            <p>An identifier is a name used to identify a class, variable, function, or any other user-defined item. The
                basic rules for naming classes in C# are as follows −</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A name must begin with a letter that could be followed by a sequence of letters, digits (0 - 9) or
                    underscore. The first character in an identifier cannot be a digit.</li>
                <li>It must not contain any embedded space or symbol such as? - + ! @ # % ^ & * ( ) [ ] { } . ; : " ' /
                    and \. However, an underscore ( _ ) can be used.</li>
                <li>It should not be a C# keyword.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>C# Keywords</h3>
            <p>Keywords are reserved words predefined to the C# compiler. These keywords cannot be used as identifiers.
                However, if you want to use these keywords as identifiers, you may prefix the keyword with the @
                character.</p>
            <p>In C#, some identifiers have special meaning in context of code, such as get and set are called
                contextual keywords.</p>

            </header>
            <p>The variables in C#, are categorized into the following types −</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Value types</li>
                <li>Reference types</li>
                <li>Pointer types</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Value Type</h3>
            <p>Value type variables can be assigned a value directly. They are derived from the class
                <strong>System.ValueType</strong>.</p>
            <p>The value types directly contain data. Some examples are <strong>int</strong>, <strong>char</strong>, and <strong>float</strong>, which
                stores numbers, alphabets, and floating point numbers, respectively. When you declare an <strong>int</strong>
                type, the system allocates memory to store the value.</p>
            <p>The following table lists the available value types in C# 2010 −</p>

            <p>To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use the <strong>sizeof</strong>
                method. The expression <em>sizeof(type)</em> yields the storage size of the object or type in bytes.
                Following is an example to get the size of <em>int</em> type on any machine −</p>
            <div class="codes">
                <code>using System;<br>
                        <br>
                        namespace DataTypeApplication {<br>
                           class Program {<br>
                              static void Main(string[] args) {<br>
                                 Console.WriteLine("Size of int: {0}", sizeof(int));<br>
                                 Console.ReadLine();<br>
                              }<br>
                           }<br>
                        }
                    </code>
            </div><br>
            <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result −</p>
            <div class="codes"> <code>Size of int: 4</code></div><br>
            <h3>Reference Type</h3>
            <p>The reference types do not contain the actual data stored in a variable, but they contain a reference to
                the variables.</p>
            <p>In other words, they refer to a memory location. Using multiple variables, the reference types can refer
                to a memory location. If the data in the memory location is changed by one of the variables, the other
                variable automatically reflects this change in value. Example of <strong>built-in</strong> reference types are:
                <strong>object</strong>, <strong>dynamic</strong>, and <strong>string</strong>.</p>
            <h3>Object Type</h3>
            <p>The <strong>Object Type</strong> is the ultimate base class for all data types in C# Common Type System (CTS).
                Object is an alias for System.Object class. The object types can be assigned values of any other types,
                value types, reference types, predefined or user-defined types. However, before assigning values, it
                needs type conversion.</p>
            <p>When a value type is converted to object type, it is called <strong>boxing</strong> and on the other hand, when an
                object type is converted to a value type, it is called <strong>unboxing</strong>.</p>
            <div class="codes">
                <code>object obj;<br>
                        obj = 100; // this is boxing
                    </code>
            </div><br>
            <h3>Dynamic Type</h3>
            <p>You can store any type of value in the dynamic data type variable. Type checking for these types of
                variables takes place at run-time.</p>
            <p>Syntax for declaring a dynamic type is −</p>
            <div class="codes"><code>dynamic <variable_name> = value;</code></div><br>
            <p>For example,</p>
            <div class="codes"><code>dynamic d = 20;</code></div><br>
            <p>Dynamic types are similar to object types except that type checking for object type variables takes place
                at compile time, whereas that for the dynamic type variables takes place at run time.</p>
            <h3>String Type</h3>
            <p>The <strong>String Type</strong> allows you to assign any string values to a variable. The string type is an alias
                for the System.String class. It is derived from object type. The value for a string type can be assigned
                using string literals in two forms: quoted and @quoted.</p>
            <p>For example,</p>
            <div class="codes"><code>String str = "Tutorials Point";</code></div><br>
            <p>A @quoted string literal looks as follows −</p>
            <div class="codes"><code>@"Tutorials Point";</code></div><br>
            <p>The user-defined reference types are: class, interface, or delegate. We will discuss these types in later
                chapter.</p>
            <h3>Pointer Type</h3>
            <p>Pointer type variables store the memory address of another type. Pointers in C# have the same
                capabilities as the pointers in C or C++.</p>
            <p>Syntax for declaring a pointer type is −</p>
            <div class="codes"><code>type* identifier;</code></div><br>
            <p>For example,</p>
            <div class="codes">
                <code>char* cptr;<br>
                        int* iptr;</code>
            </div><br>
            <p>We will discuss pointer types in the chapter 'Unsafe Codes'.</p>
